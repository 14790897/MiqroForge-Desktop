# Process Optimization

Analyze existing processes and recommend improvements.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Map Current State
- Document every step, decision point, and handoff
- Identify who does what and how long each step takes
- Note manual steps, approvals, and waiting times

### 2. Identify Waste
- **Waiting**: Time spent in queues or waiting for approvals
- **Rework**: Steps that fail and need to be redone
- **Handoffs**: Each handoff is a potential point of failure or delay
- **Over-processing**: Steps that add no value
- **Manual work**: Tasks that could be automated

### 3. Design Future State
- Eliminate unnecessary steps
- Automate where possible
- Reduce handoffs
- Parallelize independent steps
- Add checkpoints (not gates)

### 4. Measure Impact
- Time saved per cycle
- Error rate reduction
- Cost savings
- Employee satisfaction improvement

## Output

Produce a before/after process comparison with specific improvement recommendations, estimated impact, and an implementation plan.
